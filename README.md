# Auto Regression

The user inputs a set of points on a 400x400 canvas and the program
automatically finds the best fit line or polynomial that minimizes the
mean square distance (and is the best degree polynomial) and displays it
in real time.

## Contains

index.html: HTML file that loads p5.js and tensorflow.js
autoreg.js: File that contains all the code
p5.js: Loaded into the html file

## Inspiration

This program is inspired by The Coding Train's video in which he uses
Tensorflow.js for quadratic polynomial regression using p5.js. It (obviously)
uses ideas and a lot of the code from his main implementation, but also has
features and code written/added by me.
